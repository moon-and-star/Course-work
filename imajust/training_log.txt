caffe: command line brew
usage: caffe <command> <args>

commands:
  train           train or finetune a model
  test            score a model
  device_query    show GPU diagnostic information
  time            benchmark model execution time

  Flags from tools/caffe.cpp:
    -gpu (Optional; run in GPU mode on given device IDs separated by ','.Use
      '-gpu all' to run on all available GPUs. The effective training batch
      size is multiplied by the number of devices.) type: string default: ""
      currently: "1"
    -iterations (The number of iterations to run.) type: int32 default: 50
    -level (Optional; network level.) type: int32 default: 0
    -model (The model definition protocol buffer text file.) type: string
      default: ""
    -phase (Optional; network phase (TRAIN or TEST). Only used for 'time'.)
      type: string default: ""
    -sighup_effect (Optional; action to take when a SIGHUP signal is received:
      snapshot, stop or none.) type: string default: "snapshot"
    -sigint_effect (Optional; action to take when a SIGINT signal is received:
      snapshot, stop or none.) type: string default: "stop"
    -snapshot (Optional; the snapshot solver state to resume training.)
      type: string default: ""
    -solver (The solver definition protocol buffer text file.) type: string
      default: "" currently: "./Prototxt/experiment_4/rtsd-r1/histeq,"
    -stage (Optional; network stages (not to be confused with phase), separated
      by ','.) type: string default: ""
    -weights (Optional; the pretrained weights to initialize finetuning,
      separated by ','. Cannot be set simultaneously with snapshot.)
      type: string default: ""
